## Key Concepts Learned

The following HTML tags and elements were covered in this lecture:

### Headings

`<h1>` to `<h6>`: Tags for creating headings of various sizes. `<h1>` represents the main heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
```
### Text Formatting Tags

`<p>`: Paragraph tag, used for wrapping text into paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

`<b>` and `<strong>`: Both tags are used for bold text, but <strong> also conveys emphasis (used for important text).

```html
<b>Bold text</b>
<strong>Important bold text</strong>
```

`<i>` and `<em>`: Used for italicizing text. <em> indicates emphasized text.

```html
<i>Italic text</i>
<em>Emphasized italic text</em>
```

`<mark>`: Used to highlight text, typically used for search results or important sections.

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

`<br>`: Line break tag to insert a new line without starting a new paragraph.

```html
Line 1<br>Line 2
```

### Lists

`<ul>`: Unordered list tag, used to create bullet-point lists.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

`<ol>`: Ordered list tag, used to create numbered lists.

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
```

### Tables

`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`: Tags used to create tables.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Forms

`<form>` : Used to create a form for collecting user input.

```html
<form action="/submit">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Video Tag

`<video>`: Used to embed a video file into a webpage.

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
