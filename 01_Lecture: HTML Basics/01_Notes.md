# HTML Basics

In this lecture, I learned the foundational concepts of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the standard language used to create and design webpages. This lecture introduced me to various HTML tags that are essential for building the structure of a webpage.

## Key Concepts Learned

The following HTML tags and elements were covered in this lecture:

### Headings

`<h1>` to `<h6>`: Tags for creating headings of various sizes. `<h1>` represents the main heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
```
### Text Formatting Tags

`<p>`: Paragraph tag, used for wrapping text into paragraphs.

```
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```
