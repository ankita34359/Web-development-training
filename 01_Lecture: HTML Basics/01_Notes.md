# HTML Basics

In this lecture, I learned the foundational concepts of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the standard language used to create and design webpages. This lecture introduced me to various HTML tags that are essential for building the structure of a webpage.

## Key Concepts Learned

The following HTML tags and elements were covered in this lecture:

### Headings

`<h1>` to `<h6>`: Tags for creating headings of various sizes. `<h1>` represents the main heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
```
### Text Formatting Tags

`<p>`: Paragraph tag, used for wrapping text into paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

`<b>` and `<strong>`: Both tags are used for bold text, but <strong> also conveys emphasis (used for important text).

```html
<b>Bold text</b>
<strong>Important bold text</strong>
```

`<i>` and `<em>`: Used for italicizing text. <em> indicates emphasized text.

```html
<i>Italic text</i>
<em>Emphasized italic text</em>
```

`<mark>`: Used to highlight text, typically used for search results or important sections.

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

`<br>`: Line break tag to insert a new line without starting a new paragraph.

```html
Line 1<br>Line 2
```

### Lists

`<ul>`: Unordered list tag, used to create bullet-point lists.
