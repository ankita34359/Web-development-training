# CSS Basics Part II

## Lecture Overview

In this lecture, I learned about CSS properties related to Positioning and Backgrounds. These properties are fundamental in creating visually appealing layouts and controlling the placement of elements on a webpage.

This document provides a detailed explanation of the properties covered in the lecture, with examples to help us understand how to use them effectively.

## Position Properties

CSS `position` defines how an element is positioned in the document flow. There are five main values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`. Here's an overview of each:

### 1. position: static (Default)

- **Description:** The default positioning of elements. Elements are placed in the natural flow of the document.
- **Use Case:** No additional positioning; the browser determines the position.

```html
div {
    position: static;
}
```
